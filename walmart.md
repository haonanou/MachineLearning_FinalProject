The goal of this dataset is to categorize 38 shopping trip types based on the items that customers purchased. There are 7 data fields and the target variable is TripType which contains 38 distinct types. Hypothetical examples of trip types: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes.

### Motivation: We want to know patterns of shopping trip types. It is an algorithmic result.

### Method: classification machine learning techniques such as random forest, k-neighbors classifier, support vector machines, decision tree classifiers, and logistic classifiers.

### Intended Experiments: we can use train test split, k-fold cross-validation, and evaluation of models' performance.
