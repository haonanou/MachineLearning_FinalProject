### Method: we can apply classification machine learning techniques such as SVM classifier, decision tree classifier,
random forest, neighbors classifiers, linear classifiers.

### Intended experiments: we can use train test split, bootstrap, k-fold cross-validation, confusion matrix to evaluating the performance of the models.

the final thing we do is can develop one algorithms search for data, and apply to see what are the outcomes or the probability which side can win the game. Also we can split data into 20 cloumns, to use regression see probability or outcome that team win game or not.
